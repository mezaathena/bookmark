# BookMark by Athena Meza


## A personal Android project to create an app that utilizes the Google Books API to track what books you read and want to read. 
The goal of this app is to practice and improve my programming skills on Android. 

### ToDo: 
- [ ] Create a basic app, that locally tracks books using user input
- [ ] Integrate with the Google Books API
- [ ] Remove the more manual book tracking, and utilize the Google Books API
